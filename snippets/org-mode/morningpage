* The Morning Journaling Ritual  :noexport:
The Morning Page checkin is "stream of consciousness" writing to empty your mind. A foolscap page has 32 ruled lines (I counted in Neha's book). Each line should contain 8 words at Max according to Pu La Deshpande. This means that 1 full page should contain 256 words. The Morning Page exercise requires you to write 3 foolscap pages worth of stream of consciousness. This means that I should be writing 768 words everyday to meet my target.
