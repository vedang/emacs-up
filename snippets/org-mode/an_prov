** Checklist post command execution
SSH into the new node and check the following: (Note: If you cannot see the node name, run a ~refresh_inventory~ command.
- [ ] Is haproxy config correctly set?
  #+begin_example
  less /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
  #+end_example
- [ ] Are the environment variables correctly set for $1 (Note that sometimes the service name as provided in command is not the same as the service name ~ dashes tend to be converted to underscores)
  #+begin_example
  less /etc/default/$1
  #+end_example
- [ ] Review logs (above step will give you log location) to make sure that the service is working correctly.
- [ ] Telnet all the host+ports that $1 needs to ensure that it has access. The haproxy config will give you all the details of the services it needs. You can also see this information in ~sudo hatop -s /run/haproxy_op.soc~ .
