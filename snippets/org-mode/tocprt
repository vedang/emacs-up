** Step 1: Identify the Objective
Often, the wording of the objective is drawn from an injection you used in creating a FRT.

** Step 2: Identify obstacles to Overcome
Create a set of Overcome entities that represent the nonexistent necessary conditions for achieving your Objective. The point here is not to list everything you will need to do to achieve your Objectives, but to identify the things you still lack. Connect each Overcome entity as a predecessor of your Objective.

** Step 3: Brainstorm milestones
Brainstorm one or more Milestone entities that will negate the obstacles. Be creative: go around, over, under, the obstacle.

** Step 4: Continue to deepen the tree
What are obstacles to implementing your milestones? Identify them and continue to create new Overcome and Milestone entites. Do this until you reach milestones that do not have any significant obstacles.

** Step 5: Read and Verify the Tree
Apply the [[brain:86DECB26-DCC2-4314-90F9-6507A18B5388][Categories of Legitimate Reservation]] and clean up the tree.

** Step 6: Trim and finalize the tree
Place the rejected milestones in a collapsed group.
