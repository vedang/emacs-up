* CRT: ${1:Current Reality Tree Title} :crt:
- Date and Time: `(ts-format "<%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M>" (ts-now))`
- Thinking Process: Sufficient Cause
- Starting Point: A set of undesirable symptoms
- End Result: The core cause of the symptoms (the constraint)
- Entities that are part of the CRT: Undesirable Effect, Precondition, Intermediate Effect.
- CRTs are used to pinpoint problems.
- Orientation: Bottom to Top
- Bias: Top
- Entity Junctor: Fuzzy OR
- Default Junctor: Fuzzy AND

** Step 1: Understand the scope of the CRT you are building
- What is your system's goal?
- What are the necessary conditions for knowing that your goal is being achieved?
- What measures do you use to know how well the necessary conditions of the goal are being met?
- Where do the boundaries of your system lie?
- What greater system is your system a part of?
- What systems does your system interact with?
- What are your system's inputs and outputs?

** Step 2: List the symptoms (un-desirable effects) that you are seeing right now
Give each UDE a simple present-tense title that is intended to be clear to any stakeholder.

** Step 3: Connect the Symptoms that are directly or indirectly related to others already in your list
Do not be too concerned about direct / indirect at this stage. We will add other entities to the picture as we grow the tree.

** Step 4: Apply the Categories of Legitimate Reservation of your rough diagram
This process will help you add additional entities and causal relationships to your diagram, helping you create a true picture of the situation.

** Step 5: Continue adding underlying causes for the effects in your diagram
** Step 6: Consider Negative Reinforcing Loops in your diagram
Are any of your UDEs aggravating the UDEs at a lower level
** Step 7: Identify Root Causes: Entities with no predecessors
Note: Preconditions are by definition out of your control.

Question:
- Have you uncovered the deepest causes over which you have some control or influence?
- Are your root preconditions actually intermediate effects with other underlying causes?
** Step 8: Trim the tree and remove unrelated entity clusters
** Step 9: Identify the core driver constraint
If you identify a root cause such that eliminating it causes a chain reaction of other problems being eliminated, then you have arrived at your core constraint.

Questions for classifying root cause into core driver:
- How many UDEs do they cause?
- How severe are the UDEs they cause?
- How much control or influence do you have other them?
