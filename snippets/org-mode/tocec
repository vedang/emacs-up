- Date and Time: `(ts-format "<%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M>" (ts-now))`
- Thinking Process: Necessary Condition
- Starting Point: A perceived conflict underlying a constraint
- End Result: Possible win-win situations
- Entities that are part of the EC: Want, Need, Common Objective, Conflict, Solution
- EC are used to find solutions that "evaporate" a conflict.
  + A conflict is defined as two mutually exclusive wants.
- Clouds are read from left to right, against the flow of the edges, using the pattern:
  + In order to *satisfy the need* we must *obtain our want* because *of our assumptions*.
- Remember that EC is just a tool for brainstorming a new set of options. Solidifying the solutions is the job of the FRT.

** Step 1: Identify the Wants
** Step 2: Identify the Conflict
Make sure to set the weight on one of the edges to Negative. This accurately reflects the mutually exclusive nature of the two wants.
** Step 3: Identify the underlying Needs
Remember that Needs are conditions which are necessary to fulfil to meet the Common Objective. Wants are actions we are taking to meet the Need.
** Step 4: Identify the Common Objective
There has to be a Common Objective that both sides agree on. There can be no conflict resolution without a common objective.
** Step 5: Ensure Clarity by reading the diagram
** Step 6: Identify and Validate Assumptions
Finding erroneous assumptions is the key to breaking the conflict. Assumptions hide underneath the Want -> Need edges, Need -> Objective edges and in the Conflict itself -- why we believe we cannot have both Wants simultaneously.

Write the assumptions as edge annotations. Write down all the valid assumptions that you can think of. Start each assumption with "Because ..."
** Step 7: Propose Solutions
Eliminate Assumptions:
- Eliminating all assumptions on an edge eliminates the necessary condition relationship between two of the entities.
- Eliminating all assumptions on the Conflict entity eliminates the perception of conflict itself.

In either of the above cases, the cloud has "evaporated", there is no conflict. If the cloud is still intact, we need to inject a Solution into it.

Questions:
- How can we satisfy Need without obtaining Want?
- How can we accomplish Common Objective without satisfying Need?
- How can we obtain both First Want as well as Second Want?
