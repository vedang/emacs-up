* TRT: ${1:Transition Tree Title}                                        :trt:
- Date and Time: `(ts-format "<%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M>" (ts-now))`
- Thinking Process: Sufficient Cause
- Starting Point: A set of goals
- End Result: Detailed actions to achieve the goals
- The Transition Tree (TRT) is an effective tool for creating an execution plan that creates a transition from the current reality to a future reality.
- Orientation: Bottom to Top
- Bias: Top
- Entity Junctor: Fuzzy OR
- Default Junctor: Fuzzy AND
- Entities used in the TRT: Goal, Precondition, Intermediate Effect, Action. Desirable Effect and Undesirable Effect, when more effects than just the Goal show up.

** Step 1: Identify the Goal
A TRT generally contains a single Goal entity (can contain more than one if the Goals are related). The Goal should be a clear, present-tense statement of the desired reality. The Goal can be taken from one of the injections in the FRT or from one of the Objectives of the PRT.

** Step 2: Identify the Intermediate Effects
For example, these are the set of Milestone entites from your PRT

** Step 3: Define a complete step
A complete step is:
1. The outcome you want to achieve (Milestone or Intermediate Effect. Or Goal)
2. A statement of the current reality. (a Precondition, or an Intermediate Effect / Milestone that was the outcome of a previous step)
3. An Action (something within your control, with clear criteria for determining that it has been carried out successfully)

The Precondition and Action must logically combine as necessary and sufficient causes to achieve the outcome.

** Step 4: Continue Building the Tree

** Step 5: Seek and Address the Negative Branches
A complete plan will terminate only with Goals and Desirable Effects

** Step 6: Read and Verify the Tree
Check if the flow of the tree makes sense with the Confidence Spinners
