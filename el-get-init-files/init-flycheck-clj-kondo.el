;;; Code:

;; This ensures that the clj-kondo checkers are the first ones in the
;; `flycheck-checkers` list. This is needed to make the chain work. To
;; create the chain, also add the following code:

(with-eval-after-load 'flycheck-joker
  (progn
    (dolist (checker '(clj-kondo-clj clj-kondo-cljs clj-kondo-cljc clj-kondo-edn))
      (setq flycheck-checkers
            (cons checker (delq checker flycheck-checkers))))

    (dolist (checkers '((clj-kondo-clj . clojure-joker)
                        (clj-kondo-cljs . clojurescript-joker)
                        (clj-kondo-cljc . clojure-joker)
                        (clj-kondo-edn . edn-joker)))
      (flycheck-add-next-checker (car checkers) (cons 'error (cdr checkers))))))

;;; init-flycheck-clj-kondo.el ends here
